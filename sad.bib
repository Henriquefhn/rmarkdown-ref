abstract = {The castor bean cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora ricinella Sacc. {\&} Berl.) is a common disease in castor bean crop (Ricinus communis L.), causing defoliation and losses. In spite of this, the evaluation of disease severity is an important decision support for adoption of strategies and tactics for disease control. Therefore the objective of this work was to elaborate and to validate a diagrammatic to evaluate cercospora leaf spot severity in the castor bean. The scale was developed based on six treatments with different irrigation depths plus the control treatment without irrigation. Based on disease incidence analysis, it was possible to select different severity levels per treatment, which were used to define the percentage intervals of foliar diseased area of the diagrammatic scale. In view of the inexistence of standardized methods for the quantification of cercospora leaf spot in the field, the levels of 0{\%}, 0.1 to 1{\%}, 1.1 to 10{\%}, 10.1 to 20{\%} and 20.1 to 45{\%} of lesioned foliar area were established, pointing out the observation that in the interval of 20 to 45{\%} leaf fall started to occur. The scale was tested according its accuracy, precision and reproducibility. For that, 40 leaves with different disease severity levels were appraised by 10 users, without and with the scale, with an interval of seven days between evaluations of the same users. The appraisers obtained better results under utilization of the scale. The scale proposed in this work presented appropriate applicability for cercospora leaf spot evaluation in castor bean. Higher disease intensity was observed in the control and in treatments with higher irrigation depth and lower irrigation frequency.},

The alternative control of powdery mildew complex (Leveillula taurica and Erysiphe sp.) in tomato in the Azapa Valley, Chile. Cien. Inv. Agr. 40(1):119-130. The powdery mildew complex (Leveillula taurica and Erysiphe sp.) is one of the major factors limiting tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) production in the Azapa Valley, Chile. This problem is especially severe in the case of protected crops because the options for the treatment of these crops with chemical fungicides are limited. This study evaluated the effects of 0.5 and 1.0 kg100 L-1 Ospo-V55{\textregistered} and 10{\%} raw cow{\&}{\#}039;s milk on tomato leaflets infected by powdery mildew complex. Ospo-V55{\textregistered}, with active ingredients consisting of 10{\%} p/p of algae extract (IB-101) and 0.8{\%} of microorganism concentrate, was evaluated in this study. Ospo-V55{\textregistered} contains flavonoids, alkaloids and phenols, oligo- and polysaccharides, 8.6{\%} protein, 0.5{\%} magnesium and trace amounts of riboflavin, niacin and ascorbic acid. Tacora Mas{\textregistered} (a mixture of 25{\%} tebuconazole and 12.5{\%} carbendazime) and Acoidal WG (wettable sulfur) were included for comparison with the Ospo-V55{\textregistered} and raw cow{\&}{\#}039;s milk treatments. A diagrammatic scale to assess the severity of the disease was validated and used to quantify the damage resulting from tomato powdery mildew and the effects of the treatments. The effect of the treatments on the germination of the conidia of L. taurica and Erysiphe sp. was also studied on water agar. Tacora Mas{\textregistered} provided the best control of powdery mildew in the field, followed by 1.0 kg100 L-1 Ospo-V55{\textregistered} and Acoidal. However, Ospo-V55{\textregistered} was more effective than Acoidal. All treatments, including raw cow{\&}{\#}039;s milk, significantly (P{\&}{\#}8804;0.05) reduced disease severity in the leaf compared with the control. Both surfaces of the leaves were assessed, and better results were obtained on the upper surface. This difference was associated with differences in wetting. Acoidal was the most effective treatment for inhibiting conidia germination, decreasing germination more than 98.2{\%}. This result differed significantly from the value of inhibition produced by Tacora Mas{\textregistered}. Ospo-V55{\textregistered} and raw cow{\&}{\#}039;s milk showed significant differences (P{\&}{\#}8804;0.05) in conidial germination compared with the control. Based on these results, we conclude that Ospo-V55 and raw cow{\&}{\#}039;s milk can be used in an integrated management program as alternative treatments to control tomato powdery mildew complex.},

abstract = {A diagrammatic scale of Alternaria Brown Spot in citrus was developed in order to standardize disease severity assessments. The scale was built taking into consideration the distribution, shape and frequency of lesions as well as minimum and maximum severity levels found in the field. Two types of symptoms widely observed at field were represented in the diagrammatic scale: small circular or irregular lesions (0.1 1 2.5 5 11 and 25{\%}) and large circular lesions (1 2.5 5 10 and 17{\%}). The validation of the scale was accomplished in two stages. Firstly, four experts estimated the severity of disease in 79 photographs of citrus fruits with symptoms without using the diagrammatic scale. Secondly, the experts estimated the severity of the disease on the same fruits, by using the scale. When the scale was not used, the coefficient of determination (r2) was 0.69, the intercept (a) 1.42 and the angular coefficient (b) 0.77, while by using the scale these parameters were 0.84, 1.59 and 0.84, respectively. The scale was shown to be appropriate for severity assessment of Alternaria Brown Spot on citrus fruits.},

As standardized and precise methods are needed for the disease severity evaluations, a diagrammatic scale containing eight levels (0,4; 1; 2; 4; 8; 16; 32 and 49{\%}) of severity was developed in this study for the disease quantification. For the scale validation four inexperienced and four expert appraisers scored leaves with different levels of severity, initially without the use of the scale and later on with its use. The estimates were compared for accuracy and precision. Using of the scale the appraisers were able to get better levels of precision and accuracy. After training, the levels of precision and accuracy were also increased, mainly for the inexperienced appraisers. The greatest errors in the disease evaluations were observed between levels 15 and 30{\%} of severity.},

abstract = {An interactive, iterative smartphone application was used on color images to distinguish diseased from healthy plant tissues and calculate percentage of disease severity. The user touches the application's display screen to select up to eight different colors that represent healthy tissues. The user then moves a threshold slider until only the symptomatic tissues have been transformed into a blue hue. The pixelated image is then ana- lyzed to calculate the disease percentage. This study reports the accuracy, precision, and robustness of Leaf Doctor using six different diseases with typical lesions of varying severity. Estimates of disease severity from Leaf Doctor were highly accurate (R2 {\$} 0.79; Cb {\$} 0.959) compared with estimates obtained from the discipline-standard, Assess. Precision was operationally defined as the ability of a rater to use Leaf Doctor and repeatedly obtain similar percentages of disease severity for the same image. Coefficients of variation were low (0.51 to 14.1{\%}) across all disease datasets but a significant negative relationship was found between the coefficient of variation of estimates and mean disease severity. Other advantages of Leaf Doctor included compar- atively less time for image processing, low cost, ease of use, ability to send results by e-mail, and the ability to create realistic standard area diagrams. Leaf Doctor is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch and is optimized for iPhone 5. It is available as a free download at the iTunes Store. Reliable,},

The proposed diagrammatic scale was considered adequate to the bacteriose severity in peach trees and it can be used in epidemiological studies and on evaluation for controlling this disease.},

abstract = {Cylindrocladium leaf spot on Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) presents high occurrence in the feld, causing losses due to defoliation since the frst year of planting. The need of quantifying the disease and the lack of already published reliable scales have generated the need of elaborating and validating a diagrammatic scale to evaluate Cylindrocladium spp. leaf spot on eucalyptus crops. The study was developed in Botucatu, S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, in an E. grandis crop aged approximately two years and showing 2.5 x 3.0 meters spacing under epidemic conditions in the feld. One hundred E. grandis leaves were collected and digitalized by using a scanner, and two scales were elaborated, the frst one performed by AFSoft software to rate colors related to healthy and injured areas and the second one by manual delineating with the aid of a tablet and image treatment on GIMP and ImageJ software. Then, severity was determined based on the sample distribution. For the visual acuity test and validation of scales, leaves were subjected to severity evaluation, without and with scale, by ten raters (fve for each scale), followed by regression analysis. Comparison of scales showed that they can be used to quantify the severity of Cyllindrocladium spp. leaf spot on E. grandis, showing higher accuracy and precision with the second method. AFSoft is indicated for the elaboration of scales with small variation among the sampling tonalities and shorter work time; otherwise, manual delineating by using a tablet is indicated.},

Despite of its economic importance, very few epidemiological studies have been carried out in Brazil. In order to conduct these studies it is necessary to develop standard methods to quantify disease severity under field conditions. Therefore, a diagrammatic key, including the levels 1, 3, 6, 10, 18, and 30{\%} of diseased leaf area, was elaborated. The severity of the white rust was estimates using the key or not in order to test its accuracy, precision and reproducibility. The diagrammatic key was validated by 10 raters using 50 leaves with different levels of severity, which were previously measured by the {\{}AutoCAD{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}}{\}} software. Two evaluations were performed with the key at 7-day intervals when different sequences of the same leaves were visually estimated by the same raters. The accuracy and precision of each rater were determined by using simple linear regression between actual and estimated severity. When the key was not used, all raters overestimated disease severity indicating the presence of constant positive errors for all levels of disease severity. The evaluations using the diagrammatic key were more accurate for the great majority of the raters and more precise for all the raters. In addition, the key also showed good repeatability and high level of reproducibility among the evaluations from the different raters. The diagrammatic key is suitable for the evaluation of severity of white rust of Chrysanthemum.},

To validate the scale, six raters quantified the disease severity of digitalized images of 50 fruits with black spot symptoms. Initially, the estimates of severity were done without the use of the scale. Then, the raters estimated the severity of the same fruits previously assessed using the proposed diagrammatic scale. Assessments with the diagrammatic scale were of greater precision and higher accuracy for all raters, besides being more highly reproducible among the different raters. The proposed diagrammatic scale was considered adequate to estimate black spot severity in citrus fruits and will be used in epidemiological studies and int he evaluation of control strategies for this disease.},

abstract = {The leaf smut, caused by the fungus Entyloma vignae, is a common disease of cowpea in the Brazilian Northeast. Considering the inexistence of standard methods for assessment of this disease, a diagrammatic key was developed with 1.5, 3.5, 7.0, 14.5, 27.0 and 45.0{\%} of diseased leaf areas and tested for accuracy, precision and reproducibility of the estimatives of leaf smut severity with and without using the key. The diagrammatic key was validated by 10 raters, with and without the key, using 48 cowpea leaflets with different levels of severity previously measured by the software {\{}AutoCAD{\{}$\backslash$textregistered{\}}{\}} for Windows. Two evaluations were performed with the diagrammatic key at 7-day interval where different sequences of the same leaves were visually estimated by the same raters. The accuracy and precision of each rater were determined by simple linear regression between actual, evaluated electronically, and estimated severity. Without the diagrammatic key most of raters overestimated disease severity. With the key raters obtained better levels of accuracy and precision, with absolute errors concentrated around 10{\%}. Raters showed good repeatability (90{\%}) and reproducibility (84{\%}) of estimative by using the key. The proposed diagrammatic key was suitable for the evaluation of severity of leaf smut on cowpea.},

abstract = {Three diagrammatic grading keys were designed for the assessment of the severity of late blight (caused by Phytophthora infestans) in tomato leaves. Simplified and broad keys considered, respectively, six (3, 12, 22, 40, 60 and 77{\%}) and eight (3, 6, 12, 22, 40, 60, 77 and 90{\%}) levels of disease severity, whilst a modified key based on a previous proposal for potato late blight considered six levels (1, 5, 10, 16, 32 and 50{\%}). The keys were validated by 24 evaluators who assessed digital images of tomato leaves exhibiting different areas with lesions. Evaluator errors were compared using a mixed model in which evaluators were considered as random effects and the keys and evaluations as fixed effects. The accuracy and precision of the evaluators were compared by simple linear regression between the estimated and actual values of disease severity. The repeatability of evaluators was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient. There was significant (P {\textless} 0 center dot 001) variability amongst the errors made by evaluators, although the precision of each of the three keys was high with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0 center dot 96, 0 center dot 93 and 0 center dot 83 for the simplified, broad and modified key, respectively. Repeatability of estimations amongst the evaluators was adequate (correlation coefficients of 0 center dot 91, 0 center dot 91 and 0 center dot 90 for the three keys, respectively). The simplified and broad keys resulted in higher precision and accuracy for the estimation of severity than did the modified key. Since the simplified key considers a smaller number of disease severity levels, its use is recommended in the assessment of late blight in tomato leaves.},

abstract = {Two standard area diagrams (SADs) to assess the severity of powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) on tomato leaves and leaflets were developed and evaluated. The SADs are composed of two sets of images of leaves and leaflets with six distinct percentages of diseased areas (1, 5, 10, 20, 40 and 60{\%}). Diagrams were evaluated by 16 raters divided into two groups, based on their former experience in assessing plant disease intensities, using the two sets of images, first without SADs and then using the proposed SADs. Lin's concordance correlation analysis of estimated vs. actual disease severities showed that precision and accuracy were clearly improved when raters were aided by the proposed diagrams, for both leaflets and leaves. Based on coefficients of determinations (R2) and on the intra-class correlations (??), the estimates of severity were consistently more reliable when using SADs. Furthermore, when the scales were adopted, the performance of the inexperienced group improved to the same level of that of the experienced group. The diagrams improved subjects' ability to accurately, precisely and reliably estimate tomato powdery mildew severity, and as such can be used to assess severity for studies in epidemiology, quantitative host resistance and in the evaluation of management practices in this important pathosystem.},

The scale was validated by 10 raters in three phases: first the raters estimated the severity in 40 photographs without using the scale. In the second and third phases, the same raters estimated the severity in the photographs but with different sequences, with a seven-day interval between assessments. Accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility of estimates were determined by linear regression, relating assessments performed by raters using the scale to actual severity, and relating the results between two assessments using the scale. Assessments with the diagrammatic scale were precise and accurate, the absolute errors were lower than the acceptable limits and the raters exhibited good repetition of estimates.

Thus, this research aimed to develop a sampling method to quantify its incidence, to characterize its symptoms, and to develop a diagrammatic scale for assessing disease severity. The minimum sample size to estimate greasy spot incidence in leaves (16 plants) was calculated based on a prospective sampling of five leaves per quadrant, four quadrants per tree, and 30 trees per grove, in ten groves. From 320 mature leaves collected in different plants of 11 groves, it was observed a high number of lesions per symptomatic leaf (mean of 131?102), most of them small (mean of 0.014?.,011cm 2). Greasy spot severity varied from 0,15{\%} to 35,85{\%}, with a mean of 7,3{\%}. Based on those severity values, a six level (1{\%}, 2{\%}, 5{\%}, 9{\%}, 18{\%} e 36{\%} of lesioned leaf area) diagrammatic scale was developed. 50 images of symptomatic leaves were showed to evaluators, which estimated the severity with and without the use of the scale.

The intermediary severity levels were determined according to "Weber-Fechner's stimulus response law" and the scale had seven severity levels (0.7; 2; 4; 8; 17; 32 and 53{\%}). Scale validation was carried out by four experienced raters and four inexperienced raters, who estimated severity with and without the use of the scale, using 50 leaves with different levels of disease. The actual severity and the estimated severity values were analyzed through linear regression, and the estimates were compared for accuracy and precision. By using the scale, the raters obtained higher precision and accuracy levels, and the variance of the absolute errors in the assessment of the disease presented values within acceptable limits. The proposed scale was thus considered appropriate for evaluation of leaf spots in arracacha.},

Considering the inexistence of standard methods for assessment of this disease, a diagrammatic scale was developed with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 82 and 92{\%} of diseased bracts area and tested for accuracy, precision and reproducibility of the estimative of anthracnose severity with and without using the scale. The diagrammatic key was validated by 10 raters, using 45 bracts with different levels of severity. Without the diagrammatic scale most of raters overestimated disease severity. With the scale raters obtained better levels of accuracy and precision, with absolute errors concentrated around 10{\%}. Raters showed great repeatability (95{\%}) and reproducibility ({\{}$\backslash$textthreesuperior{\}}90{\%} in 75.6{\%} of cases) of estimative by using the scale. The proposed diagrammatic scale was suitable for the evaluation of torch ginger anthracnose severity.},

abstract = {A diagrammatic scale was developed to standardize severity assessments of anthracnose on yellow passion fruit, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The scale was elaborated considering the maximum and minimum limits of disease severity. The percentile values for anthracnose symptoms followed logarithmic increments (1, 3, 8, 21, 44 e 70{\%}). To validate the scale, ten raters (five inexperienced and five experienced) quantified the disease severity, without and using the scale, of 50 fruits with anthracnose symptoms. Assessments with the diagrammatic scale had higher precision and accuracy for majority of raters, besides being more reproducible among raters. The proposed diagrammatic scale was considered adequate to estimate anthracnose severity in yellow passion fruits and could be used in epidemiological and control studies.},

For validation, the severity of 50 leaves presenting different intensities of the disease was estimated by ten raters. Accuracy and precision were determined by linear regression, relating assessments performed by raters using the scale to actual severity. Repetition of the results provided by raters was verified in a second evaluation, seven days after the first assessment. The scale provided good levels of accuracy and precision of visual estimates. The coefficient determination average was higher than 0.94, and absolute errors were lower than acceptable limits. Overall, the raters exhibited good repetition of estimates. The proposed diagrammatic scale proved to be adequate for severity assessments of cercospora leaf spot in watermelon.},
